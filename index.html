        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
        <p>
          It is said ‚ÄúA child‚Äôs mind is clean as paper.‚Äù I grew up in a family
          who is in the photograph business and they used to use these super
          complicated and power tools like Adobe Photoshop and Premiere to edit
          and produce photos and videos. And as I kid I used to follow in my
          families foot steps. As I copied and did what they did, I have always
          wondered how computers worked and how those softwares were built to do
          such amazing things.
        </p>
        <p>
          From those questions - which I had no answers to from my family - I
          began to read and research online how this are built. That is when I
          was in grade 6 (when I was about 12 years old).
        </p>
        <p>
          The next year my oldest sibling joined the university. There she
          learned about C++. a programing language used for building software.
          And for my 13th birthday she got me a CD containing a PDF ‚ÄúBeginning
          C++ Programming‚Äù book and Borland C++ Compiler. That is where my world
          changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I began to teach myself and understand the world of software at a very
          young age. It wasn‚Äôt long since I learned web development and started
          building websites. But my curiosity never withered, it is still active
          to this day.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the time I joined the university I had already learned and build
          out a lot of projects. So I picked to learned Electrical Engineering
          because I didn‚Äôt understand the whole process of how all the coding
          I‚Äôve been doing is working in the inside of CPU and memory. And
          through my University curriculums I was able to grasp even a deeper
          level of understanding over how each and every bit of code I wrote was
          getting executed in each device. I even learned how to build a
          processor, memory grid and everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          All my live I‚Äôve been trying to understand the world of software and
          how it can make everyone‚Äôs life better when done right! So I strive
          everywhere I go to contribute in bettering the world of software by
          building and contributing using the knowledge and wisdom I‚Äôve acquired
          so far and continue to acquire.
